## Isomorphic
Comes from a mathematical term **isomorphism**. Two objects are equal in form or shape if isomorphism exists between them. Kudos to whomever came up with that when isomorphic apps emerged. Dumbed down with term **universal**, to make it more understandable for the common folk. A welcome improvement.

## Idiomatic
Writing software using very specific language-specific guidelines or functionalities. Useful for those trying to write Java code in JavaScript.

## Holistic
Holistic approach to writing apps focuses on interdependence of components. Think of it as components mating to produce a new and improved functionality. 

## Higher order
Functional programming technique of wrapping on object (e.g function) in another to enhance the functionality. You can higher order anything and it's fun to say for the people who struggle with the _R_ sound. 

## Agnostic
When you don't really care what's going on around you. For example, device-agnostic apps should work on any smartphone out of the box. Don't confuse agnosticism for ignorance.
